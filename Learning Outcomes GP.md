### 1. Web-application
#### User Friendly:
For the group project I did some research about UX (User Experience) and how to improve it. We were making a dashboard for Bert (from Isaac A.K.A. IO) and after the dashboard was finished it was my job to test it on some basic rules to create a user friendly dashboard. Down below is a screenshot of the tips and tops I gave Rick for his UI.

#### Full-stack:
I was responsible for most of the logic in the backend of our application. The things i created for the logic in our backend are the MQTT-client (listener) and the algorithm for the sensors. The MQTT-client is part of our backend, it receives messages from the sensors at Isaac's office. These messages contain temperature and humidity measurements. They send in their data every 30 seconds. We will then store the data in a cache. So if the most recent data is needed we can simply take it out of the cache, so there is no need to run a database query.

If a sensor were to fail to send data my algorithm would get the temperature of the closest sensor. The closest sensor would be calculated using none other than the famous pythagorean theorem (A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>). The sensors are on a grid, so it is easy to get the two points of the missing sensor and the other active sensors. Using the theorem we can calculate the distance between the missing sensor and all active sensors and make a list of closest sensors to replace their data with the missing sensors data.

I also helped Yannick out a bit with the backend architecture. We're using Entity framework core for the Data Access Layer. The api-endpoints were my responsibility. I Discussed what kind of data was needed for the heatmap with Rick and Maikel, so I was sure they would get everything they needed.

### 3. Agile method
We work in an agile process in our group project. We choose the SCRUM agile methodology. Because we all are most aware with this methodology. I know about a couple of them. Like Extreme programming (XP), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM). But our team has never worked with any of those before. So we stuck with the SCRUM method.

Every morning we start with the daily stand-up. Here we will discuss what everyone will be doing for the day and where we currently are in the project (in terms of what is completed and what still needs to be done). We will grab our notion board and start assigning tasks (see picture below). At the end of the day we will perform the daily stand-down. Here we will discuss how everything went this day. Think about problems that may have occurred throughout the day, or things that just didn't go as planned.

We end every sprint with a sprint review and a sprint retrospective. The sprint review is with the product owner. We will talk about what has priority, we gather feedback to improve our product and we take a look at what we are going to focus on upcoming sprint. But most importantly we will deliver parts of the product af often as possible to get as much feedback as possible. After the sprint review we will start the sprint retrospective with our group. We will ask ourselves a lot of questions about how it went this sprint. If anything is not to our liking, we will inspect it and adapt ourselves to improve it.

| _The scrum workflow we apply in our project_ |

Agile is a very powerful way to work with in a group. My experience with the agile method is very positive. It stimulated our groups productivity and over-all professionality. Starting everyday with a daily-standup felt like we were a real developer team working for a company. It was also a great improvement for out teamwork. All of us grew even more together as a team and ofcourse as friends!

I will recommend the agile method and will be using it a lot in future projects!

### 5. Cultural differences and ethics
Cultural:
---
**What is culture?** <br>
In my eyes, culture is the way people behave, what they believe in and what brings them together. People with the same culture will probably get along better.

**Can you give examples for cultural differences that you have experienced in your study or life? How do you explain these differences?**  
At work i have to deal with a lot of different cultures at once. Many different people work at the warehouse where i work. An example of cultural difference here is the music we play. A lot of people really love pub music (a lot of songs about drinking). But that's only a small portion of the employees. Another part really likes techno. And yet another part loves hardstyle. So we constantly experience cultural differences at work.

**What is your culture?** <br>
i think i have a traditionally dutch culture. I love and take part in many traditional dutch holidays. Like Carnaval and Sinterklaas. We love playing sports like soccer and hockey. Going out on saterday evenings to drink until we drop. It's all part of the dutch culture. Always up for a party.

**What did you do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences?** <br>
We all share the same culture, so it wasn't necessary for us to adapt to each other. We sometimes switch to talking english because it's better for some of us, like how i think it's better to write my portfolio in english. So we kinda switch to a modern culture were english is a very common language.

Ethics:
---
**What is ethics in software engineering?** <br>
You need to think about the impact your software has on the users in an ethical way.

**Why is ethics important in software engineering?** <br>
If you were to only focus on money as a developer, you will miss the important ethical parts of a project. Let say you're creating a social media application but i'll do nothing to censor bad words and only focus on getting as much money as possible. The user will suffer from this.

We also played the slideshow-game with our group. Here are the questions I will be going to answer about this quiz.

| _Question at the end of the quiz_ |

1. That even though there are many countries living very close to one another, theres a distinct difference between them.
2. I will keep track of people from different countries
3. We became a western european culture. We had the same thought on most questions.
4. We got into some difficult discussions with our group.
5. I would live to know more about (for us) weird behaviours in different cultures. Like how it is normal in Vietnam to hang up a call without saying goodbye.

Here are the scores we got on the test:
Maikel : 121
Rick   : 114
Liang  : 113
Rens   : 112

Sadly I lost but it was fun to do this game with my friends. Some questions really made no sense, but it was still fun discussing about them. I learned a lot about how close countries are very different. And that every country is looked at very differently by every other country.

### 6. Requirements and design 
We try to get as much feedback as possible from our stakeholder. We try to meet every week, so we can improve our product as much as possible. Bert (our stakeholder) gives us feedback. For example our heatmap. We used a date and time picker to select a specific date and time for the heatmap to show the data of that specific date and time. Afther feedback from Bert we are now using a slider to pick the time and a date picker for the date. This is just an example of how we process the given feedback to improve our product. Let's take another example. At first we would have the lowest sensor value as the lowest point in the legend and the highest sensor value as the highest point in the legend. Afther feedback from Bert we now have a minimum value and a maximum value in the legend, the problem was that if the lowest sensor value was 24 degrees, the color in the legend would have been green... this could give users a wrong indication of how warm it is

| _Legend of the heatmap_ |

I've discussed a lot with Yannick about the design of our backend. An example of this is when we were discussing a way to easily return the most recent data. We receive data from Isaac's sensors every 30 seconds. The heatmap would only need the most recent data a sensor uploaded. So Yannick and I came up with a clever solution to store the received sensor data in a cache in the backend. This made it so no database query is needed to get all most recent data from all sensors. All thanks to the cache that stores the most recent data. We discussed and explained to each other making use of the whiteboard. This made it way easier for each other to explain ideas and problems.

On the picture below are a couple things to see, first of all everything about where we should put our MQTT listener and are stash etc. second, we needed a way to generate missing values from the sensors, for example if 1 sensor would fail to publish his data our heatmap would miss data. For this problem Yannick and I had yet another clever solution. We would use nothing other than the well known Pythagorean theorem a.k.a. (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>) to calculate the distance between the sensor with the missing value and the other sensors. We would use the value of the closest sensor for the sensor with the missing value. We discussed this problem with our stakeholder Bert and he told us it was a good solution to the problem.

| _The whiteboard session of me and Yannick_ |

Most of our design choices in our heatmap were affected by Bert's feedback. For example features like sharing an url, the legend we talked about earlier, the dropdown with arrows beside it to switch floors. We delivered almost weekly to Bert so we could easily optimize all these things i just named. As i said most of our design choices are about the frontend (heatmap). Bert will be doing a code review on our backend so we might have to make changes in our backend in terms of design.

### 7. Business processes
For our group project we don't really have a business project we can analyze. So we discussed this problem with our teacher (Marc) and came to the conclusion that we should analyze any relevant business project. So we as a group analyzed the business process of order picking. Webshops have huge warehouses filled with products that can be ordered and shipped. Advanced algorithm's create picking lists for employees to pick. We visualized this process for multiple reasons. First of all it's my job. And it was easy for me to guide our group in analyzing this process. Second of all, Rick created an order-picking system for his individual project. These two reasons let us to the decision for our business process to analyze.

We visualized the process in Engage Process Modeler. This is a tool which I had a bit of experience working with. The Engage Process Modeler makes it possible to visualize business processes. These processes can be made as advanced as one can imagine. We choose to keep it simple and clear. As a group we set down and discussed the process until we all had a clear view of the process and everyone shared the same opinion. See picture below for the visualized process.

| _Order-picking business process_ |

Because we couldn't really analyse a business process for our project or my individual one, I choose orderpicking. But I am aware of why I should be familiar with business processes for projects like these. Understanding business processes allows you to think of solutions you probably didn't think of before. Understanding these processes allows you to improve them as well. Knowing these processes you also know how users behave in a company and knowing this you can think about how the users would use your application and you can do acceptance testing.

### 8. Professional
I kind of picked up the leader role in this project. This didn't necessarily mean that I did more work then the others. We are one group and finished our project with all of us contributing, which I am happy to announce since many groups have people who dropped out. I did most of the communication with the stakeholder and product owners. Same goes for communication within the team. Especially at the start of this semester. Later on the communication would go way smoother and less forced. I enjoyed being in this position and am definitely going to expand my skills. The role of lead developer fits me and I will one day be lead developer at a company.

Another thing I did that made me feel like a professional is the fact that I always did my peer-feedback. This is a very important matter in group projects. So it's kind of sad to see not everyone in my group used this brilliant feature. Peer-feedback allows members of a project to compliment and notify all members about what they're doing. This is super beneficial for members. Receiving compliments improves their self-esteem and motivates them to keep going. And tips allow them to get aware of their own weaknesses. Most people don't know they're doing something wrong until you tell them. So members may not always know they are making mistakes. Be sure to let them know.
