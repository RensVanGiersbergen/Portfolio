### 1. Web-application
#### User Friendly:
For the group project I did some research about UX (User Experience) and how to improve it. We were making a dashboard for Bert (from Isaac A.K.A. IO) and afther the dashboard was finished it was my job to test it on some basic rules to create a user friendly dashboard. Down below is a screenshot of the tips and tops I gave Rick for his UI.

#### Full-stack:
I was responsible for most of the logic in the backend of our application. The things i created for the logic in our backend are the MQTT-client (listener) and the algorithm for the sensors. If a sensor were to fail to send data my algorithm would get the temperature of the closest sensor. The closest sensor would be calculated using none other than the famous pythagorean theorem (A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>). The sensors are on a grid, so it is easy to get the two points of the missing sensor and the other active sensors. Using the theorem we can calculate the distance of the missing sensor and all active sensors and make a list of closest sensors to replace their data with the missing sensors data.
