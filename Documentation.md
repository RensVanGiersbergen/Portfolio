# Documentation Skate Tracker
Hey welcome to my documentation for my skate tracker application.

### Project description
This project is all about tracking (electric) skaters their journey. Skaters can start the tracker on their mobile phone and pause/stop the ride. 
They can see the statistics of their journey and a map with the route they took. Skaters can see their history of journeys and the statistics of them.
They can follow each other and live-track the other's journey. Seeing where they are, how fast they go, their ridetime etc. And see the history of skaters you follow.
