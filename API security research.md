## What is an API?
API stands for _"Application programmable interface"._ An API is nothing more then software running on a server. Software can "talk to" API's to request numerous things of an API. Most common methods in an API are Get, Post, Put and Delete. The get method requests data from the API. The post sends data to an API. The put method sends new data to the API to replace old data. And the delete method request the API to delete data. These requests go to endpoints. Endpoints are the code that allows two applications to talk with each other. The requests from an application using our API all come down to an endpoint. The API will then return a status code of the request (if it succeeded or not) and maybe data that was requested (if it was a get request).

## Why is security important in API's?
API security consist of the following according to [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/api-security#:~:text=Application%20programming%20interface%20(API)%20security,the%20sensitive%20data%20they%20transfer.):
_"Application programming interface (API) security refers to the practice of preventing or mitigating attacks on APIs. APIs work as the backend framework for mobile and web applications. Therefore, it is critical to protect the sensitive data they transfer."_

API's are getting more and more common in the daily life of a software developer. It allows developers to use external systems to make their lifes easier. The amount of publicly accessible API's also keeps on rising. These API's have to be very secure and make sure no one can apply any harm. The data transferred between applications is very crucial and sensitive. For example, youtube's public API. Youtube needs to make sure that attackers can't steal data of youtube's users or do anything weird with their application.

The thing with public API's is that everybody can use them (maybe not everyone, but certainly every software engineers). This is as said above very dangerous, because not everybody has good intentions of using your API. The potential risk of getting attacked are increasing. According to a research from Salt (experts in API security), the amount of API attack increased by an extraordinary 681% over the last 12 months.
